Object Recognition

Object Recognition is a technology that falls under the broader domain of Computer Vision. This powerful technology can identify and track objects in images and videos. Also known as Object Detection, it has a wide range of applications, including face recognition, vehicle recognition, pedestrian counting, self-driving vehicles, and security systems, among others.

Objectives
The primary objectives of object recognition are:

Identification: Detecting and identifying all objects within an image.
Filtration: Focusing on specific objects of interest, filtering out irrelevant ones.
Deep Learning Techniques
Deep learning techniques have proven to be state-of-the-art for various object recognition challenges. Some commonly used approaches include:

ImageAI: A versatile library that simplifies the implementation of deep learning algorithms for object detection.
Single Shot Detectors (SSD): Efficient methods that predict bounding boxes and class scores in a single pass.
YOLO (You Only Look Once): A real-time object detection system that processes images in a single forward pass.
Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN): Methods that combine region proposals with convolutional neural networks for precise object detection.
